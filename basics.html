<h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
  <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
   headings.</p>
<h1>Lists</h1>
  <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
  <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
  <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<!-- (This is bad!) -->
<ul>
  <p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p>
</ul>

<!-- (Do this instead) -->
<ul>
  <li><p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
  <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
  <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
  <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
      an ordered list</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
phrase.</p> <!-- ITALICS -->

<p>Other times you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance
of a word or phrase.</p> <!-- BOLD -->

<p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

<h2>Line Break</h2>

<hr/>  <!--Horizontal Rule-->
<p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
soon.</p>
