  <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
  <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
   headings.</p>
  <h1>Lists</h1>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
  <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
  <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<!-- (This is bad!) -->
<ul>
  <p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p>
</ul>

<!-- (Do this instead) -->
<ul>
  <li><p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
  <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
  <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
  <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
      an ordered list</li>
</ol>
