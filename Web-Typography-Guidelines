Use “curly quotes” and apostrophes with the &rsquo;, &lsquo;, &rdquo;, and &ldquo; HTML entities.
Use proper dashes (&ndash;, &mdash;) and other symbols (&copy;).
Don’t use text-decoration: underline except for hover states.
Use real italic fonts over synthesized ones if not it’s too much of a performance burden.
